    "content": "BackstoryAround 2021 when I was interning as a software developer at a local company, I started to grow an interest in hosting my stuff, this came after hearing cool terms such as auto deploy, auto testing, DevOps, plesk, and docker. After building up some courage, I started to ask some questions to the technology manager at the time there and he began to teach me about the use of multiple domains and reverse proxies, admin panels, and he even showed me some parts of the configurations that they were using at the company, this talk had me sold the idea of running my servers and self-hosting my services.My first hardwareI managed to get hold of three old machines (for free!). I got two HP ProDesk 400 G1s, these were fairly poorly specked since they were only serving as POS terminals. These machines had an Intel Pentium G3220 paired with 2GB of RAM and 500GB HDDs. The third machine was the more powerful one, it was a Dell Optiplex 390 specked with an Intel i3-2120 with 4GB of RAM and 1TB of HDD storage.The first upgradesBefore I did any configuration or first deployment, I knew right away that I needed to upgrade these machines, so I started by ordering an 8GB stick of ram out of AliExpress (budget was tight and It somehow it still works to this day).This 8GB stick ended up in the dell machine and I split the two 2GB sticks this machine had between the HP machines, therefore leaving the Dell with 8GB of ram and the HPs with 4GB each.I also knew that I wanted a NAS, since I wasn’t really queen on trusting my data on god knows how old hard drives, therefore, I got myself a Seagate IronWolf 2TB hdd to put my most important data on.The first deploymentAfter doing some research and more chatting to the previously mentioned technology manager I ended up going for Ubuntu Server as the operating system (OS) for these machines. Once I had the OS figured out I needed to set the rolls that these machines would play in this deployment, for that I needed a list of stuff that I wanted to run:  Nextcloud  Reverse-Proxy  Docker  Minecraft Server  Octoprint for remote 3D printer control  VPNSince the Dell had the most powerful cpu and more RAM I chose it as the main server of my homelab, therefore, it was tasked with running NGINX as a reverse proxy, docker, minecraft server and VPN server. One of my HP machines got the role of being a NAS, therefore, it ran Nextcloud (and dependencies such as MySql and Redis) and some SMB shares so that I could access files more easily from my computers. The other HP machine had the singular task of running octoprint (and respective webcam stream for printer monitoring) since I didn’t want any other task bottle-necking the weak pentium CPU.This adventure was paired with a lot of trials and errors since this was my first time using linux for more serious purposes. After a couple of days, I had everything set up the way I wanted. It was an absolute blast, I was learning so much new stuff, and the feeling of learning new things by myself and making it work as intended was out of this world.At this point, I still didn’t know about the existence of tools such as Nginx Proxy Manager and was managing my subdomains directly via the config files, which wasn’t that much fun.This left me with the following setup:Re-doing everythingPart of the homelab experience is gaining more knowledge and finding better ways to do the same things. After a year of usage and adding more services to the mix, problems started to occur, drives filling up, managing the nginx config file and ssl certificates manually became increasingly more difficult to manage.To solve the hard drive filling up I decided to use linuxe’s Logical Volume Manager (LVM) which allowed me to combine multiple disks of different capacities and use them for a single big disk. In this case, I combined the space 500GB HDD with the 1TB one present in the Dell machine. In hindsight and due to the unknown past of my disks, I should have used a tool like mergerfs which wouldn’t leave me with a total loss of data if a single drive failed.The need to use LVM expand my disk space led me to just re-installing everything and doing some things better. During this major change, I also ditched the ‘raw’ use of nginx and certbot and started to use nginx proxy manager which made managing domains a breeze.Hosting my mediaEarly 2023 I stared to gain interest in hosting my own media, during this phase I tested out services like plex and jellyfin. I ended up settling for jellyfin since I wanted to use as much Open-source software as possible, another feature of jellyfin that made it even more appealing was the ability to stream live television. To make live tv and recordings available on my jellyfin, I used Tvheadend in combination with two DTV tuners. Contrary to IPTV and other digital services, most of the usb DTV tuners can only tune in to one channel at the time which makes it impossible to watch a chanel and record another ate the same time.My dvd and Blu-ray collection was of a severe size. Therefore, I also found the need to increase my HDD capacity to suit these needs. Once again LVM came in handy since I managed to find an old 2TB CCTV HDD for cheap and it made the perfect candidate for expanding the storage of server.The server tasked to handle all these tasks was the Dell optiplex, which struggled to keep up transcoding tasks and tv recordings. I must admit that I got superlucky with the use of LVM and a mix of disks with varying ages and varying working hours especially since I just added the previously mentioned CCTV HDD to my boot drive pool.New serverAfter around two months of highly stressing my Dell optiplex and losing my mind to transcodes hanging and countless streaming errors due to the lack of adequate compute power, I decided that I needed an upgrade.I started to browse the local used market (which is not very good in Portugal) and soon realized that if I wanted tons of computing power for cheap, I would have to go for an old enterprise server.I ended up settling for a used dell r620. This old beast came with two Intel Xeons E5-2670, 64GB of DDR3 ram, two 900GB sas HDDs and dual redundant PSUs. Compared to my old machines this thing was a powerhouse but a new problem appeared. This server’s chassis came configured with option to support 8 2,5” disks, but all my existing media is on 3.5” disks. To tackle this problem, I ended up moving all the drives to the optiplex machine and used that to server all my media as smb network shares.To avoid having to set everything up again, I decided to clone the drive from optiplex server to an SSD and use that as a boot disk to my new r620 server.This left me with the following setup: VirtualizationMore recently, I embarked on the journey of using Proxmox, and I’m gradually migrating all my services and applications to LXC containers. This shift has introduced new efficiencies, reduced operational costs and added capabilities to my homelab setup. In a future post, I’ll delve deeper into this transition, exploring the benefits, challenges, and detailed steps involved in moving to Proxmox and LXC containers.ConclusionIn conclusion, the journey of building and evolving my homelab has been an incredible learning experience, marked by trials, errors, and many upgrades. Starting from basic setups with old, underpowered hardware, and gradually expanding my systems to meet my needs.Thanks for reading and hope to find you around.

    "content": "Project BackstoryAround january 2021 I started to get interested in home automation systems, which led me to doing research on platforms like home assistant and hubitat.One of the requirements to finish a professional course in Portugal is the development of a final project, this project must be developed in the final year in roughly three months.Once was time to pick a topic I immediately remembered my research about the previously mentioned home automation platforms, I immediately thought ‘can I build something like this?’Fortunately, one of the topics on the list was smart home systems, and I promptly chose it.RequirementsAlthough we had freedom to use whatever tech stack we pleased, the school set the following requirements:  If a web-based front end was used, it had to use PHP  A relational database must be the primary method of providing persistence. (preferably MySql)  The database must contain at least three tables and all types of relationships.ObjectivesAfter looking at the features of existing home automation systems, I made a list of features that I wanted to implement:  Light control  Air conditioning system  Gas leakage sensing  Web radio streaming  Video doorbell system  Remote garage door opening  Control over voice assistantBuilding the ModulesAs a base for all the modules I used ESP 8266 and ESP32 micro-controllers were used, I picked those models because of their low cost, good performance and Wi-Fi capabilities.Since all modules required WiFi connectivity and communications trough MQTT I decided to make a base firmware file that handled this common behavior, this common file would then be extended my module specific control libraries. This base library also provided a web UI which could be used to change WiFi and MQTT credentials.To make developing the software easier I chose to use Vscode as my IDE alongside the PlatformIO extension. This extension makes writing and deploying code to the micro-controllers a breeze since it allows the use of Vscode great code completions and it features a library manager that allows the easy inclusion of external libraries.This also allows the compilation and uploading of code to the micro-controllers via CLI (this will come in handy in the future).Light controlTo reduce the number of micro-controllers needed I decided to run all the lights to a central module, this module used a Wemos D1 Mini as the micro-controller paired with mosfets to allow the use of high power LEDs. Below you can find the module schematic as well as a fully assembled protoboard (excuse the not-so professional soldering job 🤪).Light control PCBModule Schematic            Top View      Bottom View                              Air conditioning systemIn order to simulate the air conditioning system two fans and a temperature and humidity sensor were used. The sensor chosen was an BMP 180 due to it’s good response time, accuracy and low cost. The two previously mentioned fans were used to simulate the airflow on the indoor/outdoor ac units, to give better realism this fans were inclosed on 3D printed enclosures that looked like AC indoor/outdoor units. This module also allowed the display of current temperature and humidity readings on the UI.            Enclosure 3D View      Module Schematic                                          Temperature and humidity sensor      Indoor/outdoor units                              The change of desired temperature in a room is made through an intuitive click on a temperature gauge on the user interface (UI).User interface where temperature can be changedGas leakage sensingOne of the most important things a home can (and should have) is a gas leakage sensor (if gas is used) in order to detect and warn you about a gas leak. In order to achieve this a MQ-5 gas sensor was used in conjunction with a buzzer to provide an audible warning. The sensor was places inside a 3D printed kitchen cabinet. An event was also published via MQTT so that a warning could be displayed on the UI, this event could also be used in the future to add future actions.            Gas sensor      Protoboard                              Web radio streamingAnother feature that’s nice to have in a smart home is a central radio system, to achieve this a Vs1053 MP3 decoder board in conjunction with an esp32 micro controller. A small speaker was placed in a 3D printed enclosure to provide the sound. The target radio station (MP3 stream) and volume controls where provided via MQTT messages.            Enclosure 3D View      Protoboard                              Module SchematicVideo doorbell systemThis was one of the most challenging parts of the project since it required lots of new techniques both in the hardware and software side. The micro controller chosen was a esp32 cam, OLED display, photoresistor and high power LED (built in to micro-controller) for night time illumination. The OLED screen was used to display the current time and inform the person ringing it if it was on do-not disturb mode or not. If the do not disturb mode was enabled no sound would be produced inside of the home. This module would send an MQTT message each time the doorbell was rang. To provide real time video on the dashboard FFmpeg was used to re stream via HTTPS the local video from the ESP.            Exploded 3D View      Assembled 3D view                              Remote garage door openingIn order to simulate the opening and closing of a gate a 3D printed gate was used, this assembly featured and electric motor to move the gate and two end-stops to provide feedback of the gate’s state (in case it was moved my hand). To view and control the gate a card was shown on the UI.            3D View      Module Schematic                              To control the direction of the DC motor two relays were used, these relays would invert the polarity of the current running trough the motor which changed the gate’s direction. The gate was attached to a threaded rod and the motion was transferred via a nut inclosed in a gear.Below you can find a close up look at previously the mentioned system.Gate motion system close-upControl over voice assistantIn order to provide this project with voice control google’s dialogflow to provide a custom google assistant integration. Since this was an academic project only a few interactions (intents) were developed. ‘getTemperatureIntent’ was used to obtain the temperature in a specified room, ‘turnLightOffIntent’ and ‘turnLightOnIntent’ were used to control lights. Below you can find a listing of all the created intents and example phrases.            DialogFlow Intents      ‘getTemperatureIntent’ Phrases                              The highlighted word is the placeholder for the variable, in this case the name of the room.In order to facilitate the development of the software that would handle the requests coming from google assistant a framework was used. Jovo is an open source framework  that allows easier development of apps to run on voice assistants. This framework ran a node js webserver that gathered the data from the smart home’s api and provided responses to google assistant. To be able to provide a secure url to dialogflow’s actions an external HTTPS connection was needed, which required port-forwarding. The final presentation had to be performed on a network that didn’t allow port forwarding to the exterior.he final presentation had to be performed on a network that didn’t allow port forwarding to the exterior.Since the project’s final presentation was made in a network that didn’t allow port-forwarding ngrok was used to create an secure tunnel.Google assistant screenshotThe backendTo build this project’s backend node js and express were used. As previously mentioned the database implemented had to be MySql and it had the following tables:Database diagramThe ‘home_device’ table contains information about devices (such as light bulbs, power sockets, and gates) capable of performing actions. The ‘home_device_value’ table logs state changes of these devices and registers the user if the change is made through the smart home platform. ‘Home_device_type’ and ‘sensor_type’ tables maintain records of all existing device and sensor types along with their respective firmware files. ‘config_table’ stores the basic configurations to be uploaded to the sensors/devices.An api was also created to allow the development of external applications. The previously mentioned google assistant integration was built using this api.Allowing run-time addition of sensors and actuatorsTo give the user the ability to add new sensors/actuators and not have to manually upload firmware to the ESPs, a function was added that after the insertion of the device trough the UI it would request the user to plug the device into the computer running the backend (in this case a raspberry pi). After the user confirmed the device was plugged in, the node would launch a shell command calling PlatformIO to upload via CLI. Before uploading the code the backend would also update the config files accordingly.A house to the hardwareTo finalize this effort a miniature house was made to house all the components.A look back on the projectLooking back at this project I had a ton of fun putting this all together. This was an awesome learning experience as I got the mix the things that I love doing the most, building hardware, writing software and 3D printing. All the issues found and solutions created made me a better developer (in my opinion)."
